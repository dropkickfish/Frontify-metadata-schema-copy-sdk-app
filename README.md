# Frontify Metadata Schema Copy App
An example Frontify SDK app that can be used to copy metadata fields and options from a source library to the current library

This App was made in a weekend, scaffolded using v0.dev and ShadCN components. There are many ways that this could be optimised and is honestly a messy codebase, and is to be considered a proof of concept only.
